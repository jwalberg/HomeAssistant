# HomeAssistant

Automations and such for my smart home powered by Google and Home Assistant.

## Automations
Nightscout has been a lifesaver(literally!) in my house. When I found a Home Assistant integration for it, I went for it.

The integration as written will turn on a series of lights so I can get to sugar and my kid's room and it will read the blood sugar level across 4 different google speakers. It's triggered when their blood sugar is under 75 and will only trigger ever 5 minutes.

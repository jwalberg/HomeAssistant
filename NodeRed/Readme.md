BloodSugarMonitor is how I monitor my kid's blood sugar. It broadcasts when there's a problem and(if it's night time) turns on some lights.

A second flow in this flow starts when I turn on an input boolean named input_boolean.bg_dka_timer. Every two hours, it reminds me (with pushbullet) to check their BG and ketones.

Monitoring is down with the Nightscout integration. I'm a big fan of Nightscout and Xdrip.

KeepAlive monitors my Zigbee routers, WIFI mesh nodes, and BLE presence devices and toggles the associated outlet if the device isn't connected. It also power cycles those devices overnight. I've found that helps with stability during the day.
